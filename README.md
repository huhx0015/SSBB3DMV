## Description

This is a 3D model viewer which loads and renders (in real-time) 3D model stages and characters from the Super Smash
Bros. Brawl game. It was developed as a fan project and as a way to learn more about the XNA framework. The viewer
allowed for free-style camera controls, with the ability to fly in and around stage and character models. A simple UI
was also programmed, in which users could change the background stage, enable music/sound effects, and a toggle to 
enable a simple jumping motion for character models. 

The viewer was developed in a two person team on Visual Studio 2008/2012 and XNA Game Studio 4.0, using C# and the
Microsoft XNA Framework.

## Requirements
* Operating System: Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10
